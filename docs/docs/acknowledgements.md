# Acknowledgements

The development of esgpull has been supported by various research organizations and climate services. We gratefully acknowledge the financial and institutional support from the following projects:

## Funding Sources

### IS-ENES3 (Infrastructure for the European Network for the Earth System Modelling - Phase 3)

**Funding Period**: 2022-2023

IS-ENES3 provided crucial support for the complete rewrite of the existing ESGF download tool "synda" into what is now esgpull. This transformation modernized the codebase, improved performance, and enhanced usability while maintaining compatibility with ESGF infrastructure. IS-ENES3 is the third phase of the IS-ENES project, which provides the infrastructure for the European Network for Earth System modelling, supporting the development of tools and services that facilitate climate research and data management across European institutions.

### Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)

**Contracts**: 380 and 382

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission. C3S combines observations of the climate system with the latest science to develop authoritative, quality-assured information about the past, current and future states of the climate in Europe and worldwide.

## Community Support

Beyond financial support, esgpull has benefited from the expertise and feedback of the ESGF community, including data managers, climate scientists, and software developers who have contributed to its design and implementation.
